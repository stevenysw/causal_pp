# Methods
*  our proposed score-based method: for both low-dimensional data estimation and high-dimensional data estimation
*  endogeneous stratification
*  propensity-score matching (PSM)
*  prognostic-score matching

# Codes
*  simulation experiments (Scenarios 1-7)
*  bootstrap simulations
*  real data analysis
